Harvest is a suite of core-genome alignment and visualization tools
for quickly analyzing thousands of intraspecific microbial
genomes. Harvest includes Parsnp, a fast core-genome multi-aligner, harvest-tools, a binary archive format and format conversion tool,
and Gingr, a dynamic visual platform. Combined they provide
rapid core-genome alignments, variant calls, recombination
detection, and phylogenetic trees.
