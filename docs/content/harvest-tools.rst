**Archiving and postprocessing**

HarvestTools is a utility for creating and interfacing with Gingr files, which
are efficient archives that the Harvest Suite uses to store reference-compressed
multi-alignments, phylogenetic trees, filtered variants and annotations. Though
designed for use with Parsnp and Gingr, HarvestTools can also be used for
generic conversion between standard bioinformatics file formats.
