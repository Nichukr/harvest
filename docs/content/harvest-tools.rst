Project home page: `https://github.com/marbl/harvest-tools`

harvest-tools primarily serves as a reference-based compression tool for large genomic datasets. In addition, it serves as a proxy between several alignment and variant & annotated feature formats. While it was designed for use with both Parsnp & Gingr, it can also be used as standalone tool to efficiently compress multiple alignments, variants, phylogenies and annotations to a single convenient binary archive.
